abstract: "Multiple corrugated cartilaginous structures are formed within the mammalian nasal
capsule, eventually developing into turbinals. Due to its complex and derived
morphology, the homologies of the bat nasal turbinals have been highly disputed
and uncertain. Tracing prenatal development has been proven to provide a means
to resolve homological problems. To elucidate bat turbinate homology, we conducted
the most comprehensive study to date on prenatal development of the nasal capsule.
Using diffusible iodine-based contrast-enhanced computed tomography (diceCT), we
studied in detail the 3D prenatal development of various bat species and non-bat
laurasiatherians. We found that the structure previously identified as “maxilloturbinal”
is not the true maxilloturbinal and is only part of the ethmoturbinal I pars anterior. Our
results also allowed us to trace the evolutionary history of the nasal turbinals in bats. The
turbinate structures are overall comparable between laurasiatherians and pteropodids,
suggesting that pteropodids retain the ancestral laurasiatherian condition. The absence
of the ethmoturbinal I pars posterior in yangochiropterans and rhinolophoids has
possibly occurred independently by convergent evolution.<br><br><br>Ito, K., Tu, V. T., Eiting, T. P., Nojiri, T., and Koyabu, D. <br><b><i>Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology</i></b>. (2021)"
